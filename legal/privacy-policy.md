Please be aware that the information you choose to provide in your account profile may reveal or identify information that is not expressly stated (for example, information you provide may reveal your gender). We also store information that you upload or provide to the Services in order to provide you with the features and functionality of the Service.

**Information Your Employer Provides to Us.**  We collect information about individual users from our corporate customers who employ them.

## International Data Transfers

Rive is headquartered in the United States and has employees and service providers who operate around the globe. Therefore, as a global business, Rive processes, hosts and transfers personal information in different countries, including in the United States. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

Rive fully assesses the circumstances involving all cross-border data transfers and has appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Policy. Currently, Rive uses the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as the basis for Rives’s approach to global data privacy protection. These Standard Contractual Clauses provide appropriate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and the exercise of the corresponding rights. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards where legally required with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
