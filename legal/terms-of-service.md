# Terms of Service

The following Terms of Service (the **“Terms”**) form a binding agreement between you, in your individual capacity, or on behalf of the entity you represent, as applicable (the **“User,” “you,”** and **“your”**), and Rive, Inc., a Delaware corporation (**“Rive”**, **“we”** and **“us”**), and govern your use of the internet-based applications, software, services and websites offered by Rive (the **“Service”)**.

## A. Account Terms

### 1. Acceptance of the Terms

By creating an account on the Service (an **“Account”**), accepting an invitation to join a Team created by another User as a Team Member, or otherwise using the Service, you agree, as an individual or on behalf of the entity that you represent, to be bound by these Terms.

### 2. Account Registration

You may access certain portions of our Service on a limited, view-only basis without creating an Account or logging in, such as, for example, when a user shares Content publicly.  But in order to use most functions of the Service, you must create an Account and become a registered User. You must provide us with complete and accurate information and keep it up-to-date, including a valid email address and, if you purchase a Subscription, all required billing information.

If you create an account on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of such entity.  If you create an Account on behalf of an entity but do not have the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, then you as an individual are the User.

### 3. Account Requirements

You may use the Services only if you are 13 years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.

You may not share your Account or login credentials with other people.

You may not use Rive in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use Rive if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency.&#x20;

### 4. Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and must notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your Account.  You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account.

## B. Teams

### 1. Working with a Team &#x20;

You may use the Service in your own personal space, or you can create a shared team workspace (a **“Team”**) that allows you to use the Service collaboratively with other Users who you invite to the Team (each, a **“Team Member”**).

### 2. Team Administration &#x20;

Each Team must have at least one User who is designated as the administrator of that Team (the **“Admin”**).  By default, the User who creates a Team (the **“Owner”**) will be the Admin of the Team, but the Admin may be changed, or additional Admins may be added, by the Owner at any time.  Team Owners and Admins will have administrative permissions to add or remove Team Members, manage the rights and permissions of Team Members with respect to the Team, add or remove Content from the Team space and control billing and payments for the Team.

### 3. Access to Team Content &#x20;

Team Members may access and view the Content saved to a Team space (**“Team Content”**) subject to the permissions and access settings determined by the Admins. Any Team Members that are given editing permissions can also modify and create derivative works based upon the Team Content, as permitted by the functionality of the Service. By adding Team Members to a Team, you hereby authorize us to share all Team Content (whether completed or work in progress) with all the Team Members in that Team.  You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from sharing your Team Content with the Team Members. You understand that anyone that has access to your Team Content can copy and save their own version of it and privately edit it.

### 4. Contributions to Team Content&#x20;

If you accept an invitation to join a Team as a Team Member, then you acknowledge and agree that the Content you create, upload to, or modify on the Team space will be made available to the other Team Members as Team Content.  You hereby grant and agree to grant, or permit Rive to grant, to your Team Members the right to copy, distribute, modify and create derivative works based upon your Team Content as permitted by the functionality of the Services.  Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that the Team Owner and Admin may make Team Content available to other users under various licenses and permissions as described in Section D-6, and you hereby grant and agree to grant, or permit Rive to grant,  to other users outside of the Team the right to copy, distribute, modify and create derivative works based upon your Team Content as determined by the Team Owner and/or Admin. &#x20;

## C. Subscriptions and Payment

### 1. Pricing

The Service is free for individual Accounts, subject to these Terms.  Creation of a Team requires you to purchase a subscription to access and use the Service for such Team (a **“Subscription”**).  Your rights and the features of the Service available to your Team may depend upon the type and level of Subscription purchased. When you purchase a Subscription, you may select to be billed monthly or annually, and you will be billed immediately for the applicable interval.  Pricing, payment terms and other Subscription details are described at [help.rive.app/pricing](https://help.rive.app/pricing). &#x20;

### 2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes

You may add additional Team Members to a Team within the interface of the Service.  You will be charged for any such additional Team Members at a prorated rate for the remaining portion of the then-current billing period.

If you remove Team Members from a Team, you will be credited a prorated amount for the remaining portion of the then-current billing period.  Such credit may be applied only to future amounts payable to Rive for a Subscription and are not redeemable for cash.

You may change the type of Subscription at any time by (i) emailing us at support@rive.app and following any instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your change request or (ii) initiating a change through your Account settings within the Service.\


### 3. Payment Methods

a. **Credit Card Authorization.**  By purchasing a Subscription, you give us permission to charge your credit card or other approved method of payment for all fees incurred by you for your Subscription.  Rive does not store your credit card information itself but instead relies on its third-party credit card processor.  By purchasing a Subscription, you give us permission to share the applicable payment information with our third-party credit card processor.

b. **Invoicing.** Rive may, in its sole discretion, agree in writing to permit certain users to pay via invoice.  Any such invoice will be due within 15 days of receipt thereof, payable in U.S. Dollars. If you fail to make payment on time, Rive reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Account. You are solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on Rive's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with your Subscription.

### 4. Cancellation of a Subscription

You may cancel a Subscription at any time, effective upon the end of the then-current billing period, provided that you will not be entitled to receive any refund of any fees in connection with a cancellation.  You may cancel either within the settings interface of the Services or by emailing us at support@rive.app.

### 4. Ownership of User Content

As between you and Rive, you own your User Content - Rive does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content that you make available through the Service and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. \


### 5. License Grant to Rive

You grant us and our legal successors the worldwide, sublicensable, non-exclusive right and license to store, reproduce, display and publicly perform your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy your Content to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it.

### 6. License Grant to Other Users

a. By default, User Content that you post to, or create on, the Service is designated as “Private”.   You may additionally make User Content available to other Users as “Community Content”.

c. Community Content.  User Content that is marked as Community is accessible to all Users, and may be remixed, modified and used by all Users, including saving as their own User Content within their separate Rive account, under the creative commons license described at [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

d. Changes.  Once you have made your User Content available to another user as Community Content, you are not able to revoke the access previously provided to such other User, even if you change the permissions associated with that User Content or hide the User Content.
