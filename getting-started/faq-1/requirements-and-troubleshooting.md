# Requirements and troubleshooting

## What are the system requirements for Rive?

Currently, you can access the Rive editor via your web browser of choice. All modern browsers are supported, although we recommend using a computer with a dedicated graphics card for optimal performance.

Windows, macOS, and Linux versions of Rive will be coming in the future.

## Can I use Rive on multiple computers?

Yes, you can use Rive on as many computers as you like. Log in to your account via the browser to access all your personal and team files.

While you can use Rive on multiple computers personally, you'll need individual accounts for multiple users across computers.

## How many people can use my account?

Accounts are intended for individual use. If you want to work with a team, each team member should have their own account. Per our [Terms of Service](https://www.2dimensions.com/terms), and for your security, your account may be locked if we notice that multiple people are using it.

## What happens if my internet connection goes down?

Your files are always saved in the local storage of your browser. Even if your connection goes down, you can continue working on your file. As soon as your connection is back, Rive syncs with our online revision manager. Just make sure you find a connection before opening the file on another computer, otherwise you will not see the latest revision of that file.
