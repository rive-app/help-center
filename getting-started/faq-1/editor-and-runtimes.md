# Editor and Runtimes

## What is the Rive editor?

The editor is where you create and animate designs. From there, you can export your work ready to drop into your app or game via one of our runtimes.

If you're familiar with other design and animation tools, you'll feel right at home in the Rive editor.

You can learn more about our editor [here](../../editor/fundamentals/).&#x20;

## What are the Rive runtimes?

Runtimes are open-source libraries that allow you to play and manipulate your animations in realtime across a variety of platforms.

You can learn more about our runtimes [here](../../runtimes/overview.md).

## What's the best way to learn Rive?

The [fundamentals](../../editor/fundamentals/) section of this manual is the perfect place to get started with the core concepts of Rive. Want a series of short videos explaining specific parts of the Rive editor, concepts, and more? Check out the [Rive 101 series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujDTZWVDSsFGonP9kzAnvryowW098-p3\&si=vznV1pd1cpMhfeNK). Along the same lines, join us for our weekly livestreams, watch workshop videos, feature announcements, and more, on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Rive\_app/featured).

## What is remixing?

Remixing enables the community to create and share their own versions of a user's original creation. Want to tweak a color, some keyed frames, or completely reimagine something you find in the community? Click the Remix button on a community post to make a copy of the creation into your own files. Learn more in the [community overview](../../community/overview.md).

## How do I save my work?

Your work is automatically saved in real-time and safely stored remotely. If you lose your connection, your work will continue to be stored locally until it can be synchronized. You can access the revision history of a file via the [toolbar menu](../../editor/fundamentals/interface-overview/#toolbar) within the editor.&#x20;

## How do I export to iOS, Android, Flutter, my game engines, or the web?

Use the [export menu](../../editor/fundamentals/interface-overview/#toolbar) within the toolbar to export and download your Rive file (it will appear as `name-of-your-rive-file.riv` when downloaded). Alternatively, you can export directly from the file browser by right-clicking on a file or folder.

Use one of our runtimes to import your file into your chosen platform and begin playing and manipulating your Rive graphics in real time! You can learn more about our runtimes [here](../../runtimes/overview.md).
