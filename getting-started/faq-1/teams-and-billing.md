# Free and paid plans

## Is Rive free?

Everybody who signs up for Rive gets access to the free Individual plan. You can create a maximum of 3 files and share public files with the community.&#x20;

If you want to create a team to have unlimited files and to share files in private with other team members, then you need to pick from one of our [paid plans](../../admin/pricing/).

## What happens to my files if I cancel my paid plan?

If you cancel, your paid plan will not renew at the next billing cycle. Upon cancellation, you and any other people in your account will lose the ability to edit files. You can still view the files, but you won't be able to change them without re-activating the paid account.
