# FAQ

## Is Rive free?

Every user that signs up for Rive has a free individual space. You can create a maximum of 3 files, which are exported with the Rive logo. If you want unlimited files and to privately share and collaborate on files, then you need to pick from one of our [paid plans](../../admin/pricing/).

## Can I access the old Rive (formerly Flare)?

If you had an account for the old Rive (formerly Flare), you can still access the editor and all your files at [flare.rive.app](https://flare.rive.app).

To use the new Rive, you must create a new account to take advantage of all the [new features](improvements-in-the-new-rive.md).

## Can I import files from the old Rive (formerly Flare) into the new Rive?

Yes, but not everything is supported yet. The new Rive has a new format with different features. Some things will need to be tweaked manually. For specifics, view our page on [importing old Rive files](importing-rive-1-files.md).

## What's changed in the new Rive compared to the old version (formerly Flare)?

A lot! There's team collaboration, tons of new editor features, all-new simple-to-use runtimes for the web, Android, iOS, Flutter, game engines, and more. Read about [all the improvements](improvements-in-the-new-rive.md) in the new Rive.

## What happens if my internet connection goes down?

Your files are always saved in the local storage of your browser. You can continue working on your file even if your connection goes down. When your connection is back, Rive syncs with our online revision manager. Just make sure you find a connection before opening the file on another computer; otherwise, you will not see the latest revision of that file.

## What happens to my files if I cancel my paid plan?

If you cancel, your paid plan will not renew at the next billing cycle. Upon cancellation, you and any other people in your account will lose the ability to edit files. You can still view the files, but you won't be able to change them without re-activating the paid account.

## Are my files private?

Yes! All your files are privately stored within your personal directory. Your account also enables you to create and join teams to collaborate with your peers, remix and share files with the wider community, and access our in-app tuition material.
