The Rive interface displays a timeline with playback controls and options for the current animation in Animate mode. A list of all animations is displayed to the left of the Timeline. Keep in mind that these are animations for the currently [active artboard](../fundamentals/artboards.md#active-artboard).

**One-Shot**\
Playhead stops at the end of the animation.

**Ping-Pong**\
The playhead continuously plays from the start-point to the end-point, and back from the endpoint to the start point.

**Loop**\
The playhead continuously loops the animation from the start point to the endpoint.

**Work Area**\
The work area is used to define the playback area of an animation. Work areas are an easy way to focus on a small portion of a larger animation.



## Navigate Timeline&#x20;

The Navigate Timeline menu gives you a list of helpful shortcuts to navigate the Timeline.

## Show Only Selected

The Show Only Selected toggle can be helpful when dealing with animations that have lots of different objects keyed. When this option is toggled on, only objects that you have selected will appear on the timeline.&#x20;

## **Timeline Options**

Located to the right of the playback select, the Timeline Options show you the current time, duration, playback speed, and snap keys options.

\
**Current**\
The current position of the playhead.

**Duration**\
The total length of the timeline.

**Playback Speed**\
The speed at which the animation should play. The default speed is 1x. Negative values cause the animation to play backward.

**Snap Keys**\
The interval at which keys can be placed on the Timeline. By default, keys can be set at a subdivision of 60 for each second.

## **Navigating the Timeline**

**Scroll and Zoom**\
Use the horizontal scrollbar at the top of the Timeline (with two grabbers on each side) to scroll and resize the zoom level of the Timeline.

**Pan**\
You can also use the same pan shortcuts as the stage to pan the Timeline (right-click and drag, or hold spacebar and drag).\
