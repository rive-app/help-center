# Inspector

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-03-29 at 12.40.06 PM.png>)

An object's editable properties can be found in the Inspector. The Inspector changes dynamically depending on your selected object and where you are in the editor.&#x20;

## Align tools

The Align tools are located at the top of the inspector. Use these tools to quickly align or distribute the selected object.&#x20;

## Transform properties

The transform properties of an object appear below the Align tools. Generally, these properties include position, scale, and rotation, but can also include width and height if you have a path layer selected.

## Layer properties

Below the transform properties, you'll find a number of properties that allow you to customize the look of some objects on the stage. These properties include blend mode, opacity, fill, and stroke.

## Additional properties

Below the Layer properties, you'll find many additional properties that you can add such as [Clipping](../../manipulating-shapes/clipping.md), [Constraints](../../constraints/), [Custom Draw Order](../../animate-mode/animating-draw-order.md), and Selection Colors.
