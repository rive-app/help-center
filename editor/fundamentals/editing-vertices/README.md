No matter the type of vector you create, you can edit the vertices by changing their position or handles in both design and animate mode.

## Edit Vertices mode

To enter Edit Vertices mode, either select the shape and hit enter twice, or select a path and hit enter once.

After activating Edit Vertices mode, you can select any vertex, reposition it, and edit the bezier handles.

### Deep Selection

When dealing with a group of shapes, you may want to select and edit a specific path. You can either find that path in the Hierarchy or you can use Deep Selection to select it directly on the Stage.

To select a path within a group on the stage, hold `⌘` (Mac) or `ctrl` (Windows) and click the target path. Alternatively, you can double-click on the path you want to select.

## Bezier Handles

### ‌**Straight**

‌The default handles are set to straight, which creates straight edges between vertices.

### Corner Radius

The Corner Radius property allows you to round straight corners. This property only appears on vertices that are set to straight.&#x20;

### ‌**Mirrored**

‌Mirrored is the default handle when you create a vertex by clicking and dragging. These handles always keep the same rotation and length.

### ‌**Detached**

‌Detached handles allow each handle to have it's own rotation and length.

### ‌**Asymmetric**

‌Asymmetric handles share the same rotation but can have lengths independently of the other.
