The Rive Editor has two distinct modes, Design and Animate. As you switch between modes, the interface changes to show the appropriate tools and options.

## Design Mode

Use Design Mode to prepare your graphics for animation. This is where you can design your own graphics with Rive's [tools](interface-overview/toolbar.md#vector-tools-menu), [import graphics from other software](importing-assets.md), or rig your graphics with [bones](../manipulating-shapes/bones/), [transform spaces](groups/transform-spaces.md), and [constraints](../constraints/).

Design Mode is the default mode for any file that doesn't have any animations created. The mode exists because Rive allows you to attach multiple animations to a single artboard, so you need a place to set up and create those graphics.&#x20;

## Animate Mode

Use [Animate Mode](../animate-mode/) to create all of the animations and [state machines](../state-machine/) for your artboard.

When you switch to Animate Mode, the UI updates to display a timeline with a list of animations for the currently [active artboard](artboards.md#active-artboard). The Inspector also updates to show key buttons next to any property that can be animated.&#x20;
