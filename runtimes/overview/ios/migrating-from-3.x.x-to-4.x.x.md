# Migrating from 3.x.x to 4.x.x

{% hint style="warning" %}
This article is out of date! Find the [new version here](https://rive.app/community/doc/migrating-from-3xx-to-4xx/docVnezHkhzA).
{% endhint %}

There should be no major changes to your code to migrate to `v4.x.x`. Starting in `v4.0.1`, you can use the same runtime package `rive-ios` to install `RiveRuntime` into native `macOS` applications.\
\
The API usage of `RiveRuntime` in iOS and macOS applications should remain the same. If you do find any discrepancies or issues, please log an issue to [https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios/issues](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios/issues).
