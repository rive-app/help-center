## Licensing

Our official runtimes are all open-source and licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). You're free to use them for personal and commercial applications.

## Contributing

Since all the runtimes are open-source, we encourage you to dive in and take a look around! If you see something missing or feel you can improve upon it, then fork it!

## Versioning

As we publish updates to our Rive editor, we will occasionally push updated runtimes to support the new features. In most cases, the newest runtimes will also support previous versions of your Rive assets, so you will not need to re-export assets to update to the latest runtimes.

There are a number of ways to export your Rive files in cases where re-exporting is necessary to take advantage of the latest features. Check out our documentation on [exporting](../editor/exporting.md) for more information.
