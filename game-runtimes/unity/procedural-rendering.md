# Procedural Rendering

In this section, youâ€™ll learn how to create custom paint and path objects. This enables you to perform custom computed draw commands using the Rive Renderer.

## Overview

The following classes are available:

* **BlendMode**: determines how the source pixels are blended with the destination pixels.
* **Color**: determines the color of the shape.
* **Gradient**: determines the color gradient of the shape (`LinearGradient` or `RadialGradient`)
* **Paint**: describes how to draw a shape - see [#paint](procedural-rendering.md#paint "mention").
* **PaintingStyle**: determines if the shape is filled or stroked.
* **Path**: defines a shape's outline or a clipping mask - see [#path](procedural-rendering.md#path "mention").
* **StrokeCap**: determines how the path's endpoints are drawn.
* **StrokeJoin**: the kind of finish to place on the joins between segments.

### RenderQueue

Create a `RenderQueue`:

```csharp
public RenderTexture renderTexture;
private RenderQueue m_renderQueue;

...

m_renderQueue = new RenderQueue(renderTexture);
```

Call `draw` on the render queue and pass in a `Path` and `Paint` object.

```csharp
m_path = new Path();
m_paint = new Paint();
m_renderQueue.draw(m_path, m_paint);
```

### Path

A path is a series of drawing commands. The path is used to define a shape's outline or a clipping mask.

Create a new path:

```csharp
m_path = new Path();
```

The `Path` class provides various methods to construct a path:&#x20;

* `moveTo`: Moves the current point to the given point.
* `lineTo`: Adds a straight line from the current point to the given point.
* `circle`: Adds a circle to the path.
* `cubicTo`: Adds a cubic bezier curve to the path.
* `quadTo`: Adds a quadratic bezier segment that curves from the current point.
* `addPath`: Adds the sub-paths of path to this path, transformed by the provided matrix.
* `close`: Closes the path. This will draw a line from the current point to the first point in the path.
* `reset`: Resets the path to an empty state.
* `flush`: to flush the path to native memory.

### Paint

Paint is used to describe how to draw a shape.&#x20;

Create a new paint:

```csharp
m_paint = new Paint();
```

The paint describes the color, gradient, style, thickness, blend mode, stroke cap, and stroke join for a shape.

Call `flush()` to flush the paint to native memory. See the [#example](procedural-rendering.md#example "mention")below.

## Example

This example demonstrates drawing an animated triangle to a [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html).

The `MonoBehaviour` to create the above:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;
using UnityEditor;

namespace Rive
{
    public class RiveProcedural : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public RenderTexture renderTexture;
        private RenderQueue m_renderQueue;
        private CommandBuffer m_commandBuffer;

        private Camera m_camera;

        Path m_path;
        Paint m_paint;
        private void Start()
        {
            m_renderQueue = new RenderQueue(renderTexture);
            m_path = new Path();
            m_paint = new Paint();
            m_paint.color = new Color(0xFFFF0000);
            m_paint.style = PaintingStyle.stroke;
            m_paint.join = StrokeJoin.round;
            m_paint.thickness = 20.0f;
            m_renderQueue.draw(m_path, m_paint);

            m_commandBuffer = new CommandBuffer();
            m_commandBuffer.SetRenderTarget(renderTexture);
            m_renderQueue.addToCommandBuffer(m_commandBuffer);
            m_camera = Camera.main;
            if (m_camera != null)
            {
                Camera.main.AddCommandBuffer(CameraEvent.AfterEverything, m_commandBuffer);
            }
        }


        private void Update()
        {
            if (m_path == null)
            {
                return;
            }
            m_path.reset();

            float expand = Time.fixedTime * 10;
            m_path.moveTo(256, 256 - 100 - expand);
            m_path.lineTo(256 + 50 + expand, 256 + 50 + expand);
            m_path.lineTo(256 - 50 - expand, 256 + 50 + expand);
            m_path.close();
            m_path.flush();


            m_paint.thickness = (Mathf.Sin(Time.fixedTime * Mathf.PI * 2) + 1.0f) * 20.0f + 1.0f;
            m_paint.flush();
        }

        private void OnDisable()
        {
            if (m_camera != null && m_commandBuffer != null)
            {
                m_camera.RemoveCommandBuffer(CameraEvent.AfterEverything, m_commandBuffer);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
