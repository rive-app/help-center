You can delete your account at any time by logging into [your account](https://rive.app/account/) or by submitting a ticket [here](https://rive.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals).&#x20;

### To cancel if you have a paid account

You must log in to your account and access your account admin page: [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account/)

Click on "Cancel Plan" on the right. Once you cancel your plan, you can then delete your team. The "Cancel Plan" link will now say "Delete Team." Delete your team and return to the main account page by clicking on Account at the top. Once your team is deleted, you can delete your entire account.&#x20;

You can delete your account on the main page if you have a free plan.&#x20;

### What happens to my data after I cancel?

Your account will be canceled immediately, and we delete all your data 90 days after cancellation.

Content that you have contributed to a team or that other users have remixed from the Community will not be deleted.

If you are the owner of a team, access to the team will be suspended for all members. If you want the team to continue, please transfer ownership of the team by making another person an admin before canceling.

Please take a look at our [Terms of Service](../../legal/terms-of-service.md#1-account-cancellation) for complete details on this.&#x20;
