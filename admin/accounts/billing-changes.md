# Billing changes

**NOTE: If you have a Legacy pricing plan and wish to change your billing from monthly to annual or vice versa, please submit a ticket** [**here**](https://rive.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) **under the Account and Billing option. We can help you process the change.**&#x20;

**Clicking on Create a Team creates a new team. It does NOT update your current team's billing.**

If you wish to update your card on file to pay your subscription, you must log in to your account. You can access your account information here: [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account/)

This is the page you will see:

If you have an active plan, it will be below the "Your Plans" section of the page.&#x20;

To update your team's billing and plan, click "Manage Team" to the right.&#x20;

On the Manage Team page, the team name is at the top, and the links to make changes are on the right side.&#x20;

To change your plan, click on "Change Plan." You can change from a Pro plan to a Team plan or switch from a Team plan to a Pro plan.

If you wish to change the card on file for your plan, select "Manage Billing." This takes you to a secure Stripe page where you can update your card on file or add a different card.
