# Pricing

Rive is free for individuals and supports paid plans for teams. Teams allow you to create a shared space where you and other team members can collaborate in real time, no matter where you are. We offer flexible plan options, and our [fair billing policy](fair-billing-policy.md) means you'll only be billed for users as you add them. We'll add a prorated credit based on your billing cycle to your account when you remove a user.
