# Pricing

Rive is free for individuals and supports paid plans for teams. Teams allow you to create a shared space where you and other team members can collaborate in real time, no matter where you are. We offer flexible plan options, and our [fair billing policy](fair-billing-policy.md) means you'll only be billed for users as you add them. When you remove a user, we'll add a prorated credit to your account.

## Individual plan

Every user that signs up for Rive has a free individual space. Free plans allow you to work on a maximum of 3 files at a time. There is a 10 MB file size limit per each image you upload into Rive.
