# Pricing

Rive is free for individuals and supports paid plans for teams. Teams allow you to create a shared space where you and other team members can collaborate in real-time, no matter where you are. We offer flexible plan options and our [fair billing policy](fair-billing-policy.md) means you'll only be billed for users as you add them, and when you remove a user we'll give the prorated credit back to you.

## Individual plan
