## Editor

Ready to start designing and animating in Rive? The editor is where you create and animate designs and utilize the powerful [State Machine](editor/state-machine/) to build your logic of how different animations mix together. From there, you can export your work ready to drop into your app or game via one of our runtimes.

## Runtimes

Runtimes are open-source libraries that allow you to playback and control your animations in real-time across a variety of platforms and frameworks, such as Web, iOS, Android, game engines (i.e., Unity and Unreal), Flutter, React Native, and more!

You can learn more about both our editor and runtimes via the respective chapters of this documentation.

The Rive format and runtimes are available through the MIT license.
